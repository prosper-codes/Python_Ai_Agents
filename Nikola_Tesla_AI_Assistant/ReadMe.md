⚡ Nikola Tesla AI Assistant

A conversational AI inspired by Nikola Tesla — visionary inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist.
This project uses LangChain, Google Gemini, and Gradio to simulate Tesla’s distinctive reasoning style: first-principles thinking, poetic precision, and an obsession with energy, frequency, and harmony.

✨ Features

🧠 Persona-driven AI
Carefully engineered system prompt to emulate Tesla’s mindset and communication style.

🔗 LangChain-powered memory
Maintains conversational context using structured message history.

💬 Interactive chat UI
Built with Gradio for fast, clean, browser-based conversations.

⚡ Google Gemini (2.5 Flash)
Fast, high-quality responses with controllable creativity.

🏗️ Tech Stack

🔐 Environment Setup

Create a .env file in the root directory:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

📦 Installation
https://github.com/prosper-codes/Python_Ai_Agents.git
cd nikola-tesla-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Running the App
python app.py


Then open your browser at:

🧠 How It Works

A system prompt defines Tesla’s personality, values, and reasoning style.

User messages and assistant replies are converted into LangChain message objects.

The prompt, history, and user input are sent to Gemini.

Responses are parsed and displayed in the Gradio chat interface.

Tesla does not merely answer — he reveals patterns.

🎛️ Customization

You can easily:

Adjust temperature for more or less creativity

Modify the system prompt for stricter logic or more mysticism

Add streaming responses or long-term memory

Swap personas (Einstein, Da Vinci, Turing…)
